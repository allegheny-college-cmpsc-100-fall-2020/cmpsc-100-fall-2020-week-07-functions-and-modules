    "To this point, we've relied on either \"built-in\" or self-written code to create and run our programs. However, the universe of Python is mighty, and there are many ways that we can augment our programs by bringing in _other_ functionality from what are called _modules_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask: \"Why don't we just have all of this stuff from the beginning?\" It's a good question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without delving into all sorts of discussions about application performance, \"bloatware,\" and general difficulties with the idea of \"what do we include,\" it's enough to say that we don't need every bit of functionality _all the time_. For example, we haven't had to use any random numbers to this point, right?\n",
